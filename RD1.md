**Objective:**
In this lab I got practice with lists, functions, loops, and random numbers. I was tasked to create a program that would simulate rolling two dice, and output a chart of the results, with how many times a certain sum of the two dice was rolled.

------------------

**Procedure:**
First, we read the read me file, and worked together to think of an algorithm that would work. Once we had finalized our design and decided which tasks would be grouped into functions, we started coding. After each section was added, we tested it to make sure there were no errors. Once we were finsihed, we tested it multiple times again to double-check that everything was as it should be. The key concepts we explored were functions and lists.

---------------

**Results:**
Our results matched what we expected to get, but only after testing. We used various test cases, including ones that would be considered bad user input, to check our error checking.

------------------

**Reflection:**
The main challenge we encountered was with the list component, and adding a new value to represent number of times that a particular sum was rolled to the correct index. We followed the first three rules of programming by closely reading the read me file and designing before we started our code. Afterwards and during, we tested multiple times to ensure that there were no errors. We overcame our challenges with the list, but only after trying different types of code, and deciding to use our current code instead of the append function. I think we learned what we were supposed to for this lab. Working with Leif went well, and he was very helpful when we faced challenges. I had no issues with him.
