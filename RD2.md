In this lab, we were tasked with building a machine that would roll two dice a given number of times and create a table of how many times a sum of the die was rolled.
In doing so, we utilized the random module in python, as well as lists and some of their key functions (append, pop, etc).
The lab was predominantly centered around the use of the aforementioned lists and their functions, hence it became a key concept throughout.
When it came to the algorithm, there were some minor tweaks that needed to be adjusted. The code needed error checking and a start/stop function after the first go-around so we implimented this into it
This lab did not have any test cases to speak of.
In essence, the challenges mostly came down to working with lists and trying to figure out how to get them to work the way they are supposed to.
Most of the takeaways I had during this lab involved lists, and just cemented how I can use them for what I want them to do.
This seemed to be the point of the lab overall, so as such, I think I learned what I was supposed to.
Working with my partner didn't stem into any issues.
